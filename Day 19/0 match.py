1. What is match-case?

match checks a value
case compares that value with different patterns

👉 When a match is found, that block runs.

>> Syntax:

match variable:
    case value1:
        statement
    case value2:
        statement
    case _:
        statement

>> Explanation
match variable: → value to check

case value: → possible option

case _: → default (like else)
